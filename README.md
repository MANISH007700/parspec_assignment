- [x] : Extract text from the pdf files and save them in a .txt file [ ~ 30 mins ] - time taken to extract text, not for code [ start date - 30/11/23 ]
- [x] : Convert the extracted text into a csv file [ for both train and test ]. This csv will be used for finetuning model
- [x] : Finetuned BERT base model and BERT large model, had issues in bert large model. Satisfied with bert base
- [x] : Try out Debertav3 model from MSFT for text classification  [ couldn't do it, since model is large and no compute power]
- [x] : Benchmarking the scores on test data 
- [x] : Add a tutorial NB for the team to run the code and check preds
- [ ] : Host on Streamlit and Heroku / run locally using Streamlit

# will talk in depth in interview and also in my documentation
