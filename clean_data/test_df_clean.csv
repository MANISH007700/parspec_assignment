The TrueZero360 light   fixture was designed with a lofty vision to reach specific high-achieving performance goals. Through a great deal of research  and development, USAI created a 5-part patented optical system to deliver that result – Quiet Comfort Optics. Our innovative reflector and lens combination keeps the light focused and framed into a beam to prevent scatter and unwanted  brightness from bouncing back into the space. This reduces glare, backlight, and maintains a subtle luminance on the lens face  so that the entire assembly disappears into the light.

TrueZero 360 TM 19 5/8” (plan view) Truly Zero 00"" Regress   Wall Wash  usailighting.com  22 21  usailighting.com RELATED PRODUCTS FAQS Q: How can I choose between the flat  glass version and the regressed lens?  A: The Truly Zero flat glass (00” regress)  aligns with the ceiling plane which creates  a seamless, minimalistic below-ceiling  appearance. Also, the flat glass option is  aesthetically identical between downlight,  adjustable and wall wash, which helps  maintain visual consistency in the ceiling  even when the light fixture functions may  be different. When the lights are off, the  Truly Zero 00” regress keeps a uniform,  monolithic surface. This trim is available  with a white or black edge detail for  smooth integration with light and dark  ceilings.   The Truly Subtle 3/8” regress lens trim  with black baffle finish provides the lowest  glare rating available. The below ceiling  appearance of this trim style is closer to  that of a traditional downlight, while still  providing all the performance and benefits  of the Quiet ComfortTM Optics optical  system. The white baffle finish is brighter  and can provide the highest light levels  possible.  Q: What design challenges can this  fixture help resolve?  A: The Quiet Comfort Optics for the wall  wash optical system is extremely forgiving.  For an odd geometry like a soffit, you   will be able to mount the fixture as close  as 12 inches away from the wall. The  downlights can provide highly efficient  light levels with flexibility in fixture  placement and low to no glare. In finished  installations, the full TrueZero360 family  forms a flat and seamless ceiling plane  with a modern aesthetic.  Q: Can the trim be painted to match  the ceiling finish color?  A: The Truly Zero 00” regress trims are  available with white and black edge  details for seamless integration with both  light and dark ceilings. Since there is no  flange, no painting to match is necessary.  The Truly Subtle 3/8” regress trims   are also available with white and black  flange options.  Q: Which control systems are  compatible with TrueZero360? A: As with all USAI Lighting products,  TrueZero360 is compatible with every  major architectural control system you  could choose to use, including 0 - 10V  low voltage dimming, line voltage   phase dimming, and digital dimming  protocols such as DMX and DALI. Q: Can I place TrueZero360 in   wet locations such as showers and  outdoor covered spaces? A: Yes! The TrueZero360 family is UL dry/ damp/wet location rated and can be  installed outdoors under covered ceilings. Q: Can I change the TrueZero360 LED  color and beam spread from below? A: Yes! Optics, LEDs and dimming drivers  are field interchangeable. If a change  is desired in any of these components,  USAl's engineering has made this access  easy and painless.  Q: Can I use TrueZero360 to meet my  project’s code requirements?  A: Yes! As with all USAI Lighting fixtures,  this product family is NRTL/CSA-US tested  to UL standards and IBEW union made.  TrueZero360 is Dry/Damp/Wet location  listed and is rated for use in steam rooms  and saunas, up to 15W maximum, and  is UL2043 rated for use in air handling  plenums.

The TrueZero360 light   fixture was designed with a lofty vision to reach specific high-achieving performance goals. Through a great deal of research  and development, USAI created a 5-part patented optical system to deliver that result – Quiet Comfort Optics. Our innovative reflector and lens combination keeps the light focused and framed into a beam to prevent scatter and unwanted  brightness from bouncing back into the space. This reduces glare, backlight, and maintains a subtle luminance on the lens face  so that the entire assembly disappears into the light. The TrueZero360 wall wash fixture boasts superior application efficiency,  with over 82% of light output illuminating the wall. Downlight optics are provided with an inner baffle to control glare.

TrueZero 360 TM 19 5/8” (plan view) Truly Zero 00"" Regress   Wall Wash  usailighting.com  22 21  usailighting.com RELATED PRODUCTS FAQS Q: How can I choose between the flat  glass version and the regressed lens?  A: The Truly Zero flat glass (00” regress)  aligns with the ceiling plane which creates  a seamless, minimalistic below-ceiling  appearance. Also, the flat glass option is  aesthetically identical between downlight,  adjustable and wall wash, which helps  maintain visual consistency in the ceiling  even when the light fixture functions may  be different. When the lights are off, the  Truly Zero 00” regress keeps a uniform,  monolithic surface. This trim is available  with a white or black edge detail for  smooth integration with light and dark  ceilings.   The Truly Subtle 3/8” regress lens trim  with black baffle finish provides the lowest  glare rating available. The below ceiling  appearance of this trim style is closer to  that of a traditional downlight, while still  providing all the performance and benefits  of the Quiet ComfortTM Optics optical  system. The white baffle finish is brighter  and can provide the highest light levels  possible.  Q: What design challenges can this  fixture help resolve?  A: The Quiet Comfort Optics for the wall  wash optical system is extremely forgiving.  For an odd geometry like a soffit, you   will be able to mount the fixture as close  as 12 inches away from the wall. The  downlights can provide highly efficient  light levels with flexibility in fixture  placement and low to no glare. In finished  installations, the full TrueZero360 family  forms a flat and seamless ceiling plane  with a modern aesthetic.  Q: Can the trim be painted to match  the ceiling finish color?  A: The Truly Zero 00” regress trims are  available with white and black edge  details for seamless integration with both  light and dark ceilings. Since there is no  flange, no painting to match is necessary.  The Truly Subtle 3/8” regress trims   are also available with white and black  flange options.  Q: Which control systems are  compatible with TrueZero360? A: As with all USAI Lighting products,  TrueZero360 is compatible with every  major architectural control system you  could choose to use, including 0 - 10V  low voltage dimming, line voltage   phase dimming, and digital dimming  protocols such as DMX and DALI. Q: Can I place TrueZero360 in   wet locations such as showers and  outdoor covered spaces? A: Yes! The TrueZero360 family is UL dry/ damp/wet location rated and can be  installed outdoors under covered ceilings. Q: Can I change the TrueZero360 LED  color and beam spread from below? A: Yes! Optics, LEDs and dimming drivers  are field interchangeable. If a change  is desired in any of these components,  USAl's engineering has made this access  easy and painless.  Q: Can I use TrueZero360 to meet my  project’s code requirements?  A: Yes! As with all USAI Lighting fixtures,  this product family is NRTL/CSA-US tested  to UL standards and IBEW union made.  TrueZero360 is Dry/Damp/Wet location  listed and is rated for use in steam rooms  and saunas, up to 15W maximum, and  is UL2043 rated for use in air handling  plenums.

The TrueZero360 light   fixture was designed with a lofty vision to reach specific high-achieving performance goals. Through a great deal of research  and development, USAI created a 5-part patented optical system to deliver that result – Quiet Comfort Optics. Our innovative reflector and lens combination keeps the light focused and framed into a beam to prevent scatter and unwanted  brightness from bouncing back into the space. This reduces glare, backlight, and maintains a subtle luminance on the lens face  so that the entire assembly disappears into the light. The TrueZero360 wall wash fixture boasts superior application efficiency,  with over 82% of light output illuminating the wall. Downlight optics are provided with an inner baffle to control glare.

TrueZero 360 TM 19 5/8” (plan view) Truly Zero 00"" Regress   Wall Wash  usailighting.com  22 21  usailighting.com RELATED PRODUCTS FAQS Q: How can I choose between the flat  glass version and the regressed lens?  A: The Truly Zero flat glass (00” regress)  aligns with the ceiling plane which creates  a seamless, minimalistic below-ceiling  appearance. Also, the flat glass option is  aesthetically identical between downlight,  adjustable and wall wash, which helps  maintain visual consistency in the ceiling  even when the light fixture functions may  be different. When the lights are off, the  Truly Zero 00” regress keeps a uniform,  monolithic surface. This trim is available  with a white or black edge detail for  smooth integration with light and dark  ceilings.   The Truly Subtle 3/8” regress lens trim  with black baffle finish provides the lowest  glare rating available. The below ceiling  appearance of this trim style is closer to  that of a traditional downlight, while still  providing all the performance and benefits  of the Quiet ComfortTM Optics optical  system. The white baffle finish is brighter  and can provide the highest light levels  possible.  Q: What design challenges can this  fixture help resolve?  A: The Quiet Comfort Optics for the wall  wash optical system is extremely forgiving.  For an odd geometry like a soffit, you   will be able to mount the fixture as close  as 12 inches away from the wall. The  downlights can provide highly efficient  light levels with flexibility in fixture  placement and low to no glare. In finished  installations, the full TrueZero360 family  forms a flat and seamless ceiling plane  with a modern aesthetic.  Q: Can the trim be painted to match  the ceiling finish color?  A: The Truly Zero 00” regress trims are  available with white and black edge  details for seamless integration with both  light and dark ceilings. Since there is no  flange, no painting to match is necessary.  The Truly Subtle 3/8” regress trims   are also available with white and black  flange options.  Q: Which control systems are  compatible with TrueZero360? A: As with all USAI Lighting products,  TrueZero360 is compatible with every  major architectural control system you  could choose to use, including 0 - 10V  low voltage dimming, line voltage   phase dimming, and digital dimming  protocols such as DMX and DALI. Q: Can I place TrueZero360 in   wet locations such as showers and  outdoor covered spaces? A: Yes! The TrueZero360 family is UL dry/ damp/wet location rated and can be  installed outdoors under covered ceilings. Q: Can I change the TrueZero360 LED  color and beam spread from below? A: Yes! Optics, LEDs and dimming drivers  are field interchangeable. If a change  is desired in any of these components,  USAl's engineering has made this access  easy and painless.  Q: Can I use TrueZero360 to meet my  project’s code requirements?  A: Yes! As with all USAI Lighting fixtures,  this product family is NRTL/CSA-US tested  to UL standards and IBEW union made.  TrueZero360 is Dry/Damp/Wet location  listed and is rated for use in steam rooms  and saunas, up to 15W maximum, and  is UL2043 rated for use in air handling  plenums.
